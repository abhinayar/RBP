                                    We have designed a <span class="content-bold">unique process</span> for strategy development — one that we believe is superior to <span class="content-bold">any</span> other approach in the consulting field. We rely on our own brand, <span class="content-bold">Right Brain</span>, to inspire and guide us, so that our process and our techniques are all based on how the mind works. We base our Right Brain Strategy Development process on the following discoveries and principles:

                                            We engage the entire marketing team from the very beginning. Why? Because without their involvement and participation, the process <span class="content-bold">does not work.</span>

                                            Our approach is based on a <span class="content-bold">whole brain perspective</span>. Just as a person cannot function with various body parts operating according to their own agendas, so too organizations are unable to function effectively when there are artificial walls separating their various functions.

                                            Marketing is an <span class="content-bold">integral</span> part of the entire company. Therefore, the team that works on the brand strategy must include representation from all functions of the company.

                                            <br/>At different times we have included people from sales, advertising, public relations, market research, operations, legal, finance, research and development, manufacturing, human resources and the executive level in the Brand Strategy Development process.

                                            We know that our clients are the <span class="content-bold">experts</span> on their businesses and that they know far more about them than we do. In fact, we find that they know far more than they realize. People have much tacit knowledge about the businesses they work in - tacit knowledge that cannot be used for business decisions until it is <span class="content-bold">articulated</span>.

                                            We use techniques for the facilitation process that are designed to <span class="content-bold">unleash natural creativity.</span> These techniques are based on neuroscience and how the mind works. Specifically, they are inspired by our understanding of the right and left brain and how they work together.
